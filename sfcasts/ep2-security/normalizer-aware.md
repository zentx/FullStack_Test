# A "Normalizer Aware" Normalizer

When a `User` object is being normalized, our `UserNormalizer` is called. After
adding a dynamic group to `$context`, we want to send the `User` object *back*
through the full normalizer system: we want the *original*, "core" normalizer - whatever
class that might be - to do its magic. Right now, we're not *quite* accomplishing
that because we're directly calling a *specific* normalizer - `ObjectNormalizer`.

So... how can we call the "normalizer chain" instead of this specific normalizer?
By implementing a new interface: `NormalizerAwareInterface`.

[[[ code('138f6dc4a5') ]]]

This requires us to have a single new method `setNormalizer()`. When the serializer
system see that a normalizer has this interface, *before* it uses that normalizer,
it will call `setNormalizer()` and pass a normalizer object... that *really* holds
the "chain" of *all* normalizers. It, sort of, passes us the top-level normalizer -
the one that is responsible for looping over all of the normalizers to find the
correct *one* to use for this data.

So, we *won't* autowire `ObjectNormalizer` anymore: remove the constructor and
that property. Instead, `use NormalizerAwareTrait`. That trait is just a shortcut:
it has a `setNormalizer()` method and it stores the normalizer on a protected
property.

[[[ code('eb90b7938b') ]]]

The end result is that `$this->normalizer` is *now* the main, normalizer chain.
We add the group, then pass `User` back through the original process.

And... some of you *may* already see a problem with this. When we hit Execute to
try this... it runs for a few seconds, then... error!

Yay! Recursion! We're changing the `$context` and then calling `normalize()` on
the original normalizer chain. Well... guess what that does? It once again calls
`supportsNormalization()` on this object, we return true, and it calls `normalize()`
on us again. We're basically calling *ourselves* over and over and over again.

Wah, wah. Hmm. We only want to be called *once* per object being normalized. What
we need is some sort of a flag... something that says that we've *already* been
called so we can avoid calling ourselves again.

## Avoiding Recursion with a $context Flag

The way to do this is by adding a flag to the `$context` itself. Then, down in
`supportsNormalization()`, if we see that flag, it means that we've already been
called and we can return false.

But wait... the `$context` isn't passed to `supportsNormalization()`... so that's
a problem. Well... not a big problem - we can get that by tweaking our interface.
Remove `NormalizerInterface` and replace it with `ContextAwareNormalizerInterface`.
We can do that because it extends `NormalizerInterface`. The only difference is
that this interface requires our method to have one extra argument: `array $context`.

[[[ code('4c2609cc1f') ]]]

For the flag, let's add a constant: `private const ALREADY_CALLED` set to, how
about, `USER_NORMALIZER_ALREADY_CALLED`. Now, in `normalize()`, right *before*
calling the original chain, set this: `$context[self::ALREADY_CALLED] = true`.
Finally, in `supportsNormalization()`, if `isset($context[self::ALREADY_CALLED])`,
return false. That will allow the "normal" normalizer to be used on the second
call.

[[[ code('326e8f3354') ]]]

We've done it! We've fixed the recursion! Let's celebrate by hitting Execute and...
more recursion!

## Removing hasCacheableSupportsMethod()

Because... we're missing *one* subtle detail. Find the `hasCacheableSupportsMethod()`
method - this was generated for us - and return `false`. 

[[[ code('4edae3b2e1') ]]]

Go back up, hit Execute and... it works! The `phoneNumber` field is still randomly included... because we
have some random logic in our normalizer... but the `@id` and `@type` JSON-LD stuff
is back!

The `hasCacheableSupportsMethod()` is an optional method that each normalizer can
have... which relates to this optional interface - `CacheableSupportsMethodInterface`.
The purpose of this interface - and the method - is performance.

Because *every* piece of the object graph is normalized, the serializer calls
`supportsNormalization()`... a *lot* of times. If your `supportsNormalization()`
method *only* relies on the `$format` and the *class* of `$data` - basically
`$data instanceof User`, then you can return `true` from `hasCacheableSupportsMethod()`.
When you do this, the serializer will only call `supportsNormalization()` once per
class. That speeds things up.

But as *soon* as you rely on the `$data` itself or the `$context`, you need to
return false... or remove this interface entirely, both have the same result. This
forces the serializer to call our `supportNormalization()` method each time the
chain is called. That *does* have a performance impact, but as long as your logic
is fast, it should be minor. And *most* importantly, it fixes our issue!

Next, let's add the proper security logic to our class and then investigate
*another* superpower of normalizers: the ability to add *completely* custom fields.
We'll add a strange... but potentially useful boolean field to `User` called `isMe`.
